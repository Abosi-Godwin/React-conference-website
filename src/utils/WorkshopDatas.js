While developers want to embrace new shiny technologies, tech leaders raise concerns about the risk of exposing their data for training, alongside other accuracy issues such as source hallucination. Using vector search alongside LLMs can ground applications to a known source, and allow the generation of domain-specific responses. In this talk, I'll show how to combine Elasticsearch and Langchain in serverless applications to build a grounded RAG application and show results in a simple React UI."
